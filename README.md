# Build a Portfolio Site
My final project for "Intro to HTML and CSS" under the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree 
[(View on Udacity)](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

## Brief summary
The project makes use of Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) CSS framework to easily implement responsiveness for most aspects of the website. 
Responsiveness was also added for image elements and bodies of text to conform to different screen sizes. This site was written in HTML and CSS.

## Development process
1. A repository was created in GitHub and cloned to a local machine
2. The directory was opened in a code editor, and the necessary files for the website were created
    * `index.html` file in root directory
    * `assets/css`, `assets/img`, `assets/js`
    * `main.css` in `assets/css`
    * Added Udacity vector image in `assets/img`
3. Initialized Node.js project using `npm init`
4. Edited `main.css` and `index.html` files as needed to conform to mockup
5. Validated `main.css` and `index.html` at [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/)
6. Minified `main.css` to `main.min.css`

## Running the project
### Displaying with a browser
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `site` directory
3. Open `index.html` with your desired browser
### Emulating a server
_Assuming you have the latest version of Node.js installed..._
1. Install the `http-server` module globally (`npm install -g http-server`) (skip this step if you already have this)
2. Clone repository to your local machine, make sure you know where you saved it
3. Run `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are up-to-date
4. Use your desired command line to navigate to the root directory of the repository
5. Enter the command: `http-server site`

The site should be rendered and displayed at http://localhost:8080 (default port is 8080)
